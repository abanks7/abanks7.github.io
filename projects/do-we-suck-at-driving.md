For the Fall '19 semester in MATH 372 we had to do a group project consisting of a statistical analysis of an issue relating to Hawaii. Our team chose to analyze the driving patterns of licensed drivers across the 4 major counties in the Hawaiian Islands - Honolulu, Hawai'i, Kauai, and Maui. Using the publicly available State of Hawaii Data Book along with resources from The Department of Business, Economic Development & Tourism Research, we extracted the data pertaining to the number of active licenses, miles travel by vehicle, and the total number of accidents.

<br>

Using the powerful statistics software Minitab, along with basic R and Excel programming, we were able to build graphs showing the relationships between the different factors across the 4 counties, along with performing more detailed statistical analysis' such as inteval plots, difference of means, normal probability plots, one-way ANOVA, and Tukey comparisons.

My role on the team was to filter and clean up the information needed from the State of Hawaii Databook into a format that was useable for Minitab and other analysis, along with using R to compute probablistic values. I was also responsible for the presentation slides itself and the overall visual structure.
